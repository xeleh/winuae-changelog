(08.12.2023)

**New features/updates**: **UI**

- On screen keyboard. Default mapped to pad button 4.
- Gamepad GUI control. Use game pad to control WinUAE GUI with some limits.
- Optional dark mode (Windows 10 or newer required)
- Emulation window dragging and resize does not anymore pause emulation.

**New features/updates**: **emulation**

- Built-in Munt MT-32/CM-32L emulation. Emulated devices listed in MIDI out setting. ROM images should be in \<WinUAE rom path\>\\mt32-roms. or c:\\mt32-rom-data\\.
- AT&T DSP3210 emulation (AA3000 prototype). Not complete.
- More programmed chipset screen mode emulation improvements.
- Disk emulation improved, undocumented disk read DMA “last word may not come in” bug emulated.
- Chipset emulation updates and fixes.
- “Autoclip screenshots” option now supports programmed native screen modes.
- Native\<\>RTG and RTG\<\>RTG mode switching optimizations.
- A2410 display card emulation updates, works now with new Picasso96 driver.
- Input panel Backslash/F11 option now has third option that restores pre-5.0 keymap behavior.
- Do not list GPT partitioned harddrives in “Add Harddrives” panel.
- Football Director 2 dongle emulation.
- Quickstart Host Configuration menu first option renamed, “Default configuration” -\> “Current host configuration”. Added new option “Default host configuration” that resets host configuration to defaults.
- Hard reset now randomizes CPU reset start up delay and initial floppy motor position.

**Bugs fixes**

- DMS brute force decryption failed to work with some encrypted DMS files.
- Alt-Tab from D3D11 fullscreen RTG mode made hardware mouse cursor invisible.
- Some configurations crashed when GUI Reset or Restart button was clicked.
- Enter GUI, eject disk, insert new disk, exit GUI: Disk was inserted immediately which is physically impossible and can confuse programs. Inserting disk without manually ejecting it first worked correctly.
- GUI Restart button didn’t fully restore GUI position/size if “Restarting” from fullscreen or full-window mode.
- Some configs crashed when GUI Restart button or Reset was pressed.
- WASAPI sound was disabled if sound driver only supported 8 channel audio.
- Some configurations opened multiple tiny inactive multi-monitor mode emulation windows without enabled multiple monitors.
- Workbench programmed screen mode (DBLPAL etc) positioning was not always correct when switching from other native mode.
- None serial port emulation mode and fast CPU configuration: serial port driver hung if serial data transmit was attempted.
- Integer scale + full window: Display panel windowed width and height was used instead of full window size (desktop size) when calculating scaling values.
- Screen might have flickered when starting Picasso96 RTG screen dragging.
- Multiple 0x76 partitions per HD/card can be mounted now, previously only first was mounted and the rest become zero size non-existing drives.
- USB HID input device usage page check fixed, it accepted devices that had nothing to do with being input device.

**Gamepad GUI control details**

A = select (pad mode)/left mouse click (mouse mode)  
B = right mouse click (mouse mode).  
Y = change active GUI area (pad mode)/TAB UI element change (mouse
mode).  
D-pad = select UI elements, “pad mode”.  
Left stick = move mouse, “mouse mode”.

Currently requires XInput compatible gamepad.

**Onscreen keyboard details**

Pad button 4 is default mapped to open/close on screen keyboard input
event (if loaded config has button 4 mapped to something else, button is
not mapped to OSK)  
Pad button/d-pad that normally controls Amiga joystick moves keyboard
selection. Joystick movements and button presses are not sent to Amiga
side as long as OSK is open.  
Fire button press = send selected key’s press  
Fire button release = send selected key’s release  
Second button press = toggle state of selected key. Keep shift or
control or other qualifier key pressed.  
Second button release = does nothing.  
Keyboard layout is US layout + 2 keys that are used in international
layout variants + few bonus “keys”.  
If GUI is entered when OSK is open, GUI pad control is automatically
enabled.
